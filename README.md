# Ariel's miscelaneous repo

This repository contains multiple scripts and stuff I've built over the time, but aren't worth maintaining an specific repository for. You may find scripts, web components and other types of test programs in different languages.

- [MFAinput](/ac-mfainput/README.md): A web component to ask users for a MFA code. You can customise how many numbers have to be provided (by default, 6).
